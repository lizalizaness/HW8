Conclusion:

The first script is designed to sort three integer variables using a specific approach, which was intresting to work with. By limiting myself to only three simple 'if' statements without relying on more complex structures like 'else' or 'elif', which I usually used in my previous homeworks or projects. Actually, that's really emphasize the pretty simplicity of Python, as anyone can programming without knowing the more advanced commands. 

The second task was satisfying, as it gives the understanding of 'type' function and how to cope with different data types (a really needed and valid skill for a programmer/data analyst). During completing the task, I also get to know with the importance of the condition checking. Counting the strings not only served a practical purpose but also helped me to appreciate how to work with different data types, which is common in real-world applications (acually, when I've done a diploma work, I stuggled a lot with text strings, so the understanding of this function and overall process is cruical).

Overall, this project has been a valuable experience, that helped me to renew the experience of working with variables. I faced some challenges, particularly with the restrictions on control ifs, but I've efficientle overcoming these struggles. I feel more confident in my ability to write clean codes.
